#### Technical Presentation Requirements
Having built your project on your own with a partner, you are the expert on it! Even though that's the case, talking about techincal topics can be challenging. Do your best to communicate what you have learned in a way others can digest.
  - Describe something you struggled to build, and show us how you ultimately implemented it in your code.
    * In FoodItem (join table), quantity being an attribute vs. counting instances of fridge_items; decided to go with instance counts because of potentially different expiration dates, etc
    * File structures, how things are piped together, what's required in run file, environment file, etc
    
  - Discuss 3 things you learned in the process of working on this project.
    * Gems: tty
    * Scope of things, calling methods, accessing variables between different classes, files, etc
    * It might take longer to build something out than you imagine

  - Address, if anything, what you would change or add to what you have today?
    * Recipe class with functions to check if an user has enough quantity of certain food to make a recipe
    * Alert users on foods expiring soon
    * Build a method to check if any food is expiring in the next x number of days

  - Present any code you would like to highlight.

  - Be prepared to answer questions from your peers!
